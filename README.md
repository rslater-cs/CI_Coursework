To run code:
- install anaconda 
- navigate to project location in termial
- conda env create -f comp_env.yml
- packages should install without error (issues may arise if using ubuntu, if so you will have to just keep running the code and getting import errors until you have manually installed all the packages)
\n(once all packages are install in an env called comp_intel) 
- conda activate comp_intel
Now you should be able to run any of the scripts with python [script_name].py
